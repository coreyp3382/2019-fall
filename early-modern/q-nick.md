# Questions On "A Changing Consciousness of History" 
1.	Lemon talks about the Renaissance and its creation of the idea of **Culture Relativism** which was “a shift in people’s perspective on time and history and was the emergence of a new awareness of different societies and cultures.” **(83)** In other terms it showed Europeans how to make sense of the world without Biblical Knowledge. *Did Historians in the past only see the use of Religion and the Church as the only was to tell history, and is it possible that they couldn’t think past the Church?* 

2.	In this chapter Lemon discusses the idea of **Humanist Curriculum**, which, “is a (‘reborn’) emphasis upon and interest in actual nature and human life ‘on this earth’, of which ‘historical consciousness’ is but one component.” **(p.80)** one example he gives is the use of poetry and the study of prose. These both give attention to Human Emotion, *in what ways dose Poetry help tell history and document it for future reference during the time of the Renaissance?*

3.	The first effects on historical consciousness was this idea of promoting **new curriculum** or as Lemon calls it the **studia humantatis**. These revolved around, “replacing the scholastic curriculum which revolved around the disciplines of logic, law, pure mathematics, science, astronomy, and metaphysical (Aristotelian) philosophy.” **(p.78)** *Why was it important for humans to focus more on the “Human World” then setting there “eyes towards heaven”? Pick one of these examples Lemon gives and tell us how it effected history and its importance on focusing on the “Human World”.*
