## Questions on chapter reading: A Changing Consciousness of History

- When discussing the Middle Ages’ lack of desire for historical consciousness, Lemon states “The irony is that, arguably, this lack of historical consciousness was precisely the product of a heightened sense of philosophy of history (albeit of a ‘**negative**’ kind)[…] **(75)**” Why does Lemon think this lack of historical consciousness is negative? Is this an example of connotative wording taken from modern perceptions of history? Why or why not?

- On page **81** Lemon states, “As people’s eyes ‘turned back’ towards man and nature, nowhere could this be seen more literally than in the realm of the fine arts and architecture.” Why does Lemon believe this to be the case? Is there something specific about art and architecture that draws out the perception of era-based movements/change? Would you argue there are other mediums that show change better than art and architecture? Is this still the case in modernity?

- Lemon discusses **“individualism”** and its effects on cultivating ‘meaning’ in history **(82)**. He states “Applied to the Renaissance, its ‘individualism’ is usually presented as one of the most positive, progressive, civilized, and humanizing aspects of its culture”**(83)**. What are the implications of not having “individualism” before now? Do societies before the Renaissance not meet these descriptions? How does "individualism" lead to civilization?

- Lemon comments that the **“cultural relativism”** would eventually lead to the growth of African Slavery **(86)**. In an era that valued the individual, had a focus on man’s potential, and focused strongly on the philosophy of life, why did the institution of slavery “boom” during this time?

- Machiavelli argued that leaders should learn from history **(94-95)** yet he stressed that historical fact was not necessarily relevant to learn, but that leaders should strive to understand the **“true sense”** or **“the spirit”** of history. What do you think Machiavelli means when he says this? Do you agree with his statement? Why or why not?
