 ## Summary for Chapter 5: _A Changing Consciousness of History_
  #### _Scholasticism_ and _Studia Humanitatis_
* Renaissance humanists rejected the previous era's intellectual system, _scholasticism_, based on a Christian-Aristotelian system, whith specialized in disciples focused on understanding the universe, and adopted a study of the human world, based on the works of men such as Plato and Cicero.  (Page 78)
  
#### Secularism
* 'Humanist' studies were "directed away from the eternities of 'Heaven' towards the varying, contingent, complex _human_ world" (80) but did not reflect a major shift away from religion.  The secular nature of the period was reflected in economic development within civil societies, and individualism. (Pages 79-83)
  
 #### 'Cultural Relativism'
* The arrival of Ptolemy's maps from the Byzantine Empire sparked a movement towards more accurate representations in mapmaking, and the Portuguese and Spanish began actively exploring the globe, completely changing the European conception of their place in the world.  (Pages 83-84)

 #### The Renaissance as a "Movement"
 * There are dangers in defining this period of history as _the Renaissance_ as, while the movement had lasting global implications, it did not entirely reflect the era.  Lemon argues that these flawed periodisations of history have value, providing shared context to historical study. (Pages 88-90)
  #### Thomas Moore
* Moore's _Utopia_ is a depiction of an ideal human society, mostly based on the work of Plato.  While Platonism does not allow the real to perfectly match the ideal, Moore's work allowed people to see, and strive for a better society. (Pages 90-92)

 #### Niccolo Machiavelli
 * Machiavelli's work reflected the importance of the study of history not just for its own sake, but to learn from it, and take it's lessons into the present, specifically in regard to statecraft. (Page 96)
 * His belief that humankind's nature was unchangable led him to the idea that human actions could be predicted, and manipulated, through careful study of the past. (Pages 96-98)
 * Though God did not play any role in his view of history, belief in God did, and Machiavelli  understood the power religion had as a tool of power.  (Pages 98 and 103)
