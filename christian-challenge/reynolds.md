### Questions ###

1.)  How do we reconcile Nisbet's linear approach with Trompf's unilinear approach when it comes to Graeco-Roman and Judeo-Christian views on history? 

2.)  When talking about Agustine, Lemon, points out that some believe that the cyclical belief that the Graeco-Romans had meant that they did not think History to be critical while some believe that the cyclical view meant that they did believe History to be an essential area of study. What do you think the cyclical view of History meant to the Greeco-Romans? Does it show that they believed History to be relevant or unimportant? 

3.) How does having one God or multiple Gods influence one's perceptions of History and the way one records History? 

4.) In academia today is History cyclical or linear? Or is it both? 

5.) How has religion influenced the historical narrative that we are taught today? What lens do we use to look at history? Is it spiritual or analytical?
