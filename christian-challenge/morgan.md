## Summary of: THE CHRISTIAN CHALLENGE TO GRAECO-ROMAN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES 

**1.)**	Roman ways of viewing the passing of history was very similar to Greek ways of doing so: both believed in cyclical history where by segments of time will eternally repeat itself through endless cycles. *However*, Roman understanding of this pattern would introduce nuances into this idea, especially the concept of **“Roman Eternal”** , that essentially states that while everyone else is living through cycles of empires, the empire of Rome has entered it’s fourth -*or arguably 5th*- stage and will continue to reign forever as a perfect empire not subjected to the laws of cycles, yet not *denying* these laws either. 

**2.)**	Christian doctrine would deeply affect how humans would conceive the passing of time as TANAK would clearly state the concept of the **beginning of humanity**, **key events within humanity history**, and a understanding that an **apocalyptic “endtime”** would eventually come. This idea forced a framing of history into one that was **linear**, not cyclical. The introduction of this new point of view invites criticism of this view in the form of many questions such as, *Are we supposed to view Christianity this way?* And *What are the underlying implications of viewing history in a linear timeline?*

**3.)**	Christian icon, **Augustine** provides commentary about the meaning of life if history is linear. In one instance we are supposed to interpret life as *meaningless* and to “just keep ones head down” until the endtimes, since only the life after the apocalypse matters. However, it could also be argued that life is *extremely meaningful* up until the apocalypse because it confirms **Christian belief in progress**. Augustine concluded on the ideas of the **“City of Man”** and the **“City of God”**, which are suggestions of how to find meaning in time based on what city you adhere to. Essentially, the readings end in a discussion of *how do we find meaning in history based on a cyclical view and a linear one?*
