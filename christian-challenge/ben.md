  ## QUESTIONS FOR THE CHRISTIAN CHALLENGES TO GRAECO-ROMAN PERSPECTIVES
  
  **QUESTION 1**  Looking at the Millennialists _Rome Eternal_ mindset and belief in cycles, would it be fair to say that free will is what sets Rome apart and immune from decay?
  
  **QUESTION2**   The _Greco-Roman_ process of cycle after cycle is based on the current empire, _embarking on the cycle_, progressing or being better than the last. If you the next empire is worse than the last does the cycle theory fall apart? Also if the cycles learned from the previous one shouldn't one empire find a way to divert the eventualy decay? 
  
  **QUESTION 3** The _Christian_ challenge of a linear philosophy where it has a starting and ending point is described as pilgrimage to make it to the **City of God**. The author argues a point that their interest in progress would be low. Would you be more accepting of an invention of progress or scientific discovery from a _Christian_ on this linear route or a _Graeco-Roman_ in the decay portion of the cycle?
  
  **QUESTION 4** Is it easier to the mindest of _Graeco-Roman_ on a linear view of time or a _Christian_ on a circular view of time?
  
  **QUESTION 5** How would each, _Graeco-Roman and Christian_, view of fate be different?
  
  **BONUS QUESTION** Is objects, themes, or ideas on a linear or circular motion in our modern world?
