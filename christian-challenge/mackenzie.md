## Questions stemed from Christian Challenges to Graeco-Roman Perspectives
  - Do we still utilize the evolved idea of the **four world monarchies** through the discoery of new lands?
  
  - As so much of today's society in America is influenced by the roman ideals, is **rome eternal** true based on the myths and continual usage?
  - The analogy of childhood has been used to describe different periods of history on both a grand and small scale, why does this anaolgy work while discussing different leading figures in the Roman empire? In any empire?
  - If Christianity had not risen, how would Rome have fallen? Would they have blamed a different source or would they have looked at their leaders to find blame within them?
