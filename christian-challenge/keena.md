## _Views of Time and History through the Monotheistic Transition_

**_1_**
Along with the shift of societies from pagan to monotheistic religions, a new understanding of temporal space formed. While this is not an immediate, one to one process, the slow shift of viewing time as cyclical to linear can be linked to the new views which came with monotheistic religiosity. Monotheism introduced a new focus on ‘progress’, as the Christian god implied a ‘fulfillment’ of one’s soul and doing good deeds for an eternal and prosperous future in His kingdom.

Many historians debate on the Christian/monotheistic influence over contemporary understandings of ancient history. Namely, Augustine’s _The City of God_ can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on if it is read in its own temporal or a Christian context. Five points are agreed upon in _The City of God_ are **1** cyclical history is rejected, **2** God created the world for good and to the benefit of man, **3** God created all things with rationality and temporal order, **4** all creatures are subject to one transcendent god, and **5** God has a plan which all must spiritually fulfil. Interpretations include a complete irrelevance of history, as earthly conditions are temporally limited and one’s true destination is the kingdom of God. On the other side, time and history are of the utmost importance as each action _earns_ one’s passage into His kingdom.

A separation of the temporal and spiritual lives of an individual occurs, or the earthly and ‘other-worldly’. The temporal view in some ways is narrowed to the lifespan of one individual or state, while the spirit is now seen as eternal and limitless. Further understood through Augustine’s idea of _two cities_ and the earthly experiences being ‘real’ while spiritual experiences are personal and independent.

A shift from belief in Fate to the idea of _free will_. Free will developed a new quest for the meaning of life, which required a view and understanding of one’s own history. These ideas expanded to states and a social shift away from the predetermined to freedom to make one’s own decisions (as long as those decisions were within Christian spiritual laws and God’s ultimate ‘plan’).

**_5_**
It is necessary, as historians, to recognize inconsistencies and ambiguities in history and historical texts without trying to ‘solve’ any ‘problem’ in history. While these resources are useful for _attempting_ to gain a better understanding of history, they are not intended to create a formula to solve our past, present, or future. History is not a science.
