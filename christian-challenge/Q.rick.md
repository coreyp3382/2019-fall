## The Christian Challenge to Graeco-Roman Historical Perspectives

1.	How could Roman (and Greek) historians draw historical parallels between their own and preceding cultures of which they had little or no knowledge?

2.	How is it that the historical retrospective on the nature of Greek and Roman views differs so wildly from the early Judeo-Christian apocalyptic narrative, one that is actually a single, long sine wave, or cycle?

3.	Can Historians claim a shift in the view of time from cyclic to linear when the Greeks, Romans, and Judeo-Christians all had origin myths, thus delineating a beginning point in time and history?

4.	How does Nisbet’s belief in a directed ‘unilinear philosophy of history’ impact current academic and religious views on history and fate, or preordination?

5.	While Neither side takes issue with the ‘creation myth’ foundation of Augustine’s polemic accounts of history, how is it that their views are so divergent in light of Augustine (unwittingly?) portraying God as being deist rather than interventionist in nature?

6.  Is it fair to characterize the Graeco-Roman view of history as cyclic, or is it more appropriate to call it recurrent?
