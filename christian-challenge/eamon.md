# Questions arising from *Christian Challenges to Graeco-Roman Perspectives*

1. When Lemon demonstrates how the dichotomy between cyclical and linear interpretations of time were not so opposed as 
might be thought (57), is he giving too much credit to early Christian thinkers?  Could this not simply be a case of 
cognitive dissonance, as scholars taught to think in a Graeco-Roman style struggle to reconcile their cyclical thought 
processes with Judeo-Christian modes of historical and chronological understanding?

2. To what degree, if any, did early Christians think of their lives as taking place in a period of great historical change? 
Was there an awareness or sense that their lives and actions, or those of their contemporaries, might later be the subject of 
historical study?

3. How might the Judeo-Christian vision of time, and thus history, be influenced by the belief (at least among Christians) in an
eternal afterlife?

4. Are Augustineâ€™s distinctions between an *Earthly City* and a *City of God* evidence of an attempt on his part to reconcile cyclical
and linear structures, repectively?
