## Questions on the readings
1. Do we view America as a society today in the same way the ancient "pagen" romans viewed Rome as "eternal"? And if we do believe in America as an eternal society, then how do we view the rest of the world? Are they still in a cyclical time relationship?

2.) The Romans view on fortune and fate seem to suppose a society without free will. Did the ancient Romans believe their fate was predestined and they could do nothing about their individula circumstances?

3.) Does religion affect our modern world as much as it affected ancient Rome? What does it mean to follow religion or to "be religious" in our modern day?

4.) Why does history retain it's importance in society regardless of if time is looked at as a linear concept or a cyclical concept? Why did some romans think so and some thought not?
