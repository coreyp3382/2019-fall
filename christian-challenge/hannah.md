# Summary of the Christian Challenge

- Pre Christian **Romans** approached the concept of future thinking as that there are **five** grand empires and that some scholars believed Rome to be the last grand empire and others believed that there was a fifth empire to come.

- Romans also viewed Rome's history in the **_' body-state'_** analogy.
-  Early Christianity believed that history was not cyclical and instead was linear with emphasis on religious events.
- **Augustine** believed that history was unimportant since the goal was to spend the mortal live obtaining the way into heaven 
- Augustines book, *The City of God*, was created to defend Christianity during the sacking of Rome and explain the relationship between Christian belief and the mortal life.
