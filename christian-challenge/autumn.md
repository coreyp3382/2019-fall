## Summarizing The Christian Challenge to Greco-Roman Perspectives
1. Greco-Roman thinkers believed in cycles of history defined by recurrent cosmological events and unchanging human nature.
2. Judeo-Christians contrastingly believed in a linear history with a beginning and an end defined by an all-powerful, beneficent god. 
3. The body-state analogy was a rhetorical method used by Greco-Romans and Christians to compare the growth of city states and the empires that followed them to the human body and its course of development. 
4. The “Four World Monarchies Myth” came about during imperial Rome and suggested that the world was destined to have four (or arguable five) transitions through great empires, the last of which would be an eternal one.
5. Augustine’s iconic work *The City of God* epitomized the thinking of the Middle Ages in that it divided the earthly world of sin and materiality from an eternal world of spiritual qualities—redefining the relevance of history in the temporary and tainted world of man on earth.
