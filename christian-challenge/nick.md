4.	Lemon explains that the Greco-Romans used this cycle after cycle method to review and learn from the previous life in order to better the future cycle. Is this cycling method relevant today as we study history and dose it fail when the future cycle dose worse then the pervious ones? How does the “body-state analogy” fit in with the cycle method? 

5.	Judeo-Christians described their view of history to be linier, in which everything has a beginning and an end which is given to us by Yaweh of God the creator.
