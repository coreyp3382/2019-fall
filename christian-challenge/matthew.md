Chapter 4 Summary



Roman Historical Concepts

Roman historical ideas were often continued and adapted from earlier Hellenistic ones.  The cyclical nature of history continued with the myth of the ‘Four World Monarchies’.  This concept expanded on the Greek concept of the inevitable rise and fall of city-states, by applying it to the rise and fall of empires.  In this cycle, Rome was often seen as the fourth empire, though there were conflicting ideas as to whether its decline was inevitable.  One argument was that Rome will fall, and be replaced by a fifth world-monarchy, one which will last forever.  Another states that, due to the exceptional nature of the Roman Empire, it has broken free of the cycle, and taken over the role of the fifth world-monarchy, as ‘Rome eternal’.

Another earlier historical concept that was adapted to suit Roman needs was looking at human history through a biological metaphor.  The ‘body-state’ analogy, as named by G.W. Trompf, compared the history of Rome to the lifespan of a human.  This did not always work in a linear fashion, as some would say an era of manhood was followed by a regression back to immature youth.  This also allowed Rome to avoid the inevitable decline and death of its metaphorical human counterpart, as it could be rejuvenated at any time.  




Augustine and Early Christian Historical Thought

The theoretical break between pagan and Judeo-Christian historical ideas is the idea of cyclical verses linear history.  Monotheism lends itself not to a ‘mythopoeic’ view, but to a singular narrative of the past, and the future.  From the creation of man, to the final judgment, the Christian viewpoint exists as a linear story of humankind.  The idea of a hard dividing line between pagan/cyclical and christian/linear is not without its detractors.  Some, like Trompf, argue that the Romans were able to think of history in a linear fashion, and that Christians have never been completely averse to viewing history in a cyclical manner.

Augustine’s “The City of God” can be viewed both as an argument for and against the relevancy of history.  If we are merely passing through the ‘Earthly City’ as pilgrims on our way to the ‘City of God’, does it really matter what happens on the ‘Earthly City’?  The attainability of the ‘City of God’ on the temporal plane is up for interpretation, and key to which view one takes.  This could mean the flow of history is replacing the ‘Earthy City’ with the ‘City of God’, which gives the actions of humankind as a whole greater meaning.

Lemon argues that the danger in attempting to interpret Augustine’s work as a pure philosophical worldview, is that it ignores the circumstances in which the it was created.  Augustine was writing, upon request, to refute claims that the rise of Christianity was directly linked to the decline of Rome.  This makes the work a much more practical one.  Augustine is making an argument, and not on a pure search for the truth of existence.
