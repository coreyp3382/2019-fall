# h1 The Christian challenge to Graeco-Roman Historical Perspectives 
04 Sep 2019
#2 Questioner 
1.	Who was the first to have the idea of “the five kingdoms”? 
2.	Were these numbers of kingdoms derived from somewhere, or are they arbitrary? 
3.	Should one try and change the real world’s physical problems, or is happiness obtained through our state of mind spiritually? (summarizing Saint Augustine)
4.	Does anyone else find it wildly coincidental that only four-hundred years after Christ died on the cross, the empire who put him there would become the capital for Catholicism/Christianity and remain so through the present?  
5.	Do the ideas of cycles driven by cosmological and historical markers that the Graeco-Romans held, and the Christian, monotheistic doctrine meet on common ground to anyone else? I connected that they both put their ‘faith’ outside the reach/control of human hands.
