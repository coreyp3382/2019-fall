# Main Points for *“The Christian Challenge to Graeco-Roman Historical Perspectives”*

  1.The view of History for *‘Pagan Thinkers’* shifted. Believed that world history centered on the succession of 4 world    monarchies(empires), and that a possible 5th eternal empire was to be the last great empire to succeed. Some even thought that Rome would be this empire and be eternal; while others believed that even if Rome was the 4th or 5th empire, it too would see its’ demise like all other empires before it.  This is called the “Four World Monarchies Myth.”

2. Graeco-Romans believed that the patterns and cycles of history was linked to cosmology and unchanged human patterns over time. 

3. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Judeo-Christians, after they were given official state recognition with Constantine’s conversion to Christianity; they had the view that history was linear, and unlike the Four World Monarchy’s myth implies, has a beginning and an end and is defined not by human actions and cosmology, but rather Yaweh , or an all-powerful being/creator. 

4. The *‘body-state analogy’* theory is a view of history in which pagan Romans and Christians compared the growth/expansion and decline of states and empires to the cycle/ development of human life. From birth to death. 

5. Augustine’s scholarly work, *‘The City of God’* is perhaps the best example of the way in which the middle ages thought about history; linear vs. never-ending, History being a result of cosmological forces and continuous human pattern vs. the result of a higher being etc. Recognizing that history has no perfect answer and cannot finitely be defined by scholarly works as well as through scientific means, is part of the process of understanding history.
